# Password-Generator

  ## Description
  
  My motivation to build this projet was to learn how to use jsvascript (how does the objects work, how does a function work, the usage of conditional statements, of for loops to iterate in things more than once, the usage of variables and arrays, also of strings to finally build an app that takes user input to generate a secure password between 8 and 128 characters).
  
  The reason to build this project was because sometimes big companies want to have more security on their users information and on they employees work, so it is a good thing to count with an application that allows the users to generate random, secure passwords taking in count multiple elements like special characters, upper and lower cases and also numbers.
  
  Talking about the problem that this project solve is that companies usually do not have enough time to generate a random secure password for their people, so what a better thing to have an application that does that work for you by only gettinf into the webpage and answer a bit of questions and you are ready to go.
  
  The main lesson of this project was how to use math random to get random characters of all the arrays of choices it was the most challenging thing to do
